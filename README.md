**CineSLEUTH: Your Ultimate Engine for Movie Recommendations**

CineSLEUTH is an intelligent movie recommendation system that combines advanced machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, fuzzy matching, and Apriori-based collaborative filtering. The system provides highly accurate and personalized movie recommendations for users.

---

## Features

1. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Uses TF-IDF vectorization to calculate similarity based on genres and tags.
   - Cosine similarity is applied to find the closest matches.
   - Fuzzy matching ensures typos are handled effectively.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Utilizes the Apriori algorithm to process user ratings and generate association rules for better recommendations.
   - Generates frequent itemsets for movies based on user behavior.

3. **Interactive User Experience**:
   - Auto-complete suggestions for movie titles with clickable options.
   - Streamlit interface for an interactive and responsive application.

4. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
   - Handles large datasets with chunk-based reading for scalability.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AaryanGole26/CineSLEUTH.git
   cd CineSLEUTH
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add the required CSV files to the repository:
   - `movies.csv`
   - `ratings.csv`
   - `tags.csv`
   - `genome_tags.csv`

   You can fetch these datasets from [MovieLens 20M Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset).

## Usage

Run the application locally using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run CineSLEUTH.py
```

### Key Features in Action:
1. Enter a movie title in the input box.
2. Get auto-complete suggestions and click to see recommendations instantly.
3. Analyze the recommendations through a table of similarity scores.
4. View Apriori-based rules generated from collaborative filtering.
